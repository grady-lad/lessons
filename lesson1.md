# Average grades

Assuming we have an array of students grades 

`var students = [['David', 80], ['Vinoth', 77], ['Divya', 88], ['Ishitha', 95], ['Thomas', 68]];
`


Write a JavaScript program which compute, the average marks of the following students Then, this average is used to determine the corresponding grade

conditions for the grades are 

````
average less than 60 is an f

average between 60 and 70 is a D

average bewtween 70 and 80 is a C

average bewtween 80 and 90 is a B 

average between 90 and 100 is an A
````

So if the average of the students grades is 88 print `average is 88, grade is a B :)`
